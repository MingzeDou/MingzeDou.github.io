# Research Interests

## Systems Neuroscience
Investigating hippocampal circuits and their interactions using advanced techniques such as high-density electrophysiology recordings. Developing analysis pipelines for large-scale neural data to reveal population-level dynamics.

## Theta Oscillations
Investigating theta oscillations in the hippocampus and medial septum, focusing on their role in neural computations and information processing. Utilizing high-density silicon probe recordings to capture and analyze these rhythmic patterns.

## Spatial Navigation & Memory
Exploring the neural mechanisms underlying spatial navigation and memory, with emphasis on how the hippocampus and its interactions with other brain regions process and represent spatial information.

## Decision Making
Analyzing neural activity patterns in the hippocampus and related structures to uncover the neural bases of behavioral choices and spatial decisions. Employing statistical analysis and machine learning approaches to identify neural-behavioral relationships and classify decision-related neural states.

## Computational Methods
Applying time series analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning to extract insights from complex neural data. Implementing analysis tools for model validation and comparison, and creating visualization tools for electrophysiology data.
